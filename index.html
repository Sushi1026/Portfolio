    <h2>Welcome to this Portfolio!</h2>
    <h3>
      Hello! My name is Fiona and I am a seventh grader. I play alto saxophone
      at the advanced band at my school and a college course outside of it. I
      also practice piano and tennis. I love food, my dog, reading, my family,
      playing and listening to music, anime, coding, tennis, and more food! Here
      at Codecentral, I have been learning coding for a very long time, with six
      digits of crypto to my name! Over the course of these years, I have
      completed many projects and assignments. Here on my portfolio, I have some
      that you can view!

        Here in the Games section, there are my personal favorite Godot games!
        In easier terms, Godot games are simply games that are created and/or
        designed in the Godot program! I decided to attach them because they
        provide a form of nostalgia and fun for whoever plays them. With bright
        colors, yummy pizza, and leafy mazes, players can challenges themselves
        and look at the code. For example, there is a "2D Snek Game" and a "2D
        Brick-Breaker Game" I have made. The snek game is a game in which you
        can control a hungry, teeny colorful snake to grow and collect pizzas
        across the map. In the brick-breaker game, you can control a paddle with
        a ball to break all the brick obstacles in your way. To code this, I
        used the script and the Godot coding language to give the separate
        "nodes" commands. As these being some of my favorite Godot games, I hope
        you enjoy them as much as I did!

        Arduino is truly something to marvel at! With the use of a circuit
        board, resistors, and other parts, people can make traffic lights,
        digital dice, and more. These Arduino projects I worked on took up a lot
        of time and effort, but in the end, the result was worth it. Projects
        like this also can display one's logical reasoning, patience, and focus.
        The arduino project shown on the side is the "Traffic Light" project.
        The traffic lights correspond to signal when cars go, slow down, and
        stop, while also displaying when pedestrians can stop and go. In the
        picture, it doesn't depict the final product, in which there are more
        resistors and lines for each LED so it could light up when commanded.
        This works by connecting the breadboard, which is shown in the image, to
        the circuit board, which is connected to the device. With this setup, I
        used pieces like the button and LEDs and put them in places on the
        breadboard, connecting the line to the circuit board. In the code, I
        corresponded the values the LED are placed at so they could run
        smoothly. Another example, not depicted, would be the "LED Dice." The
        dice lights up a random amount of LEDs to represent a random number you
        roll on a dice. Arduino is really amazing!

        Websites, much like this one, hold large amounts of information! They
        can be found everywhere online. With the use of code and some planning,
        one can design their own webpage that has images, links, text, and
        navigation bars! This portfolio is one of the webpages I have made, and
        I hope you enjoy looking at all of them! Anybody can make these webpages
        to express opinions, share information, or entertain others. Some
        webpages I have done is this one, the "Responsive Portfolio" that shares
        all the pojects I have done. Another one is my "First Website" that
        presents popular tourist places, foods, and cities to visit in Japan. It
        was created to share information that can help others. Have a look!
